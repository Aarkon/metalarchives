# ${Unoffical Encyclopedia Metallum API}

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Loki-Afro/metalarchives.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Loki-Afro/metalarchives)

Unfortunately http://www.metal-archives.com/ does not provide any API whats so ever, this library exists.
Because Encyclopedia Metallum is still the best webside to get correct and complete information about any metal band on earth.

Later it was used in an Android App to have a mobile version of the original site.
